# AI-Powered Artist Promotion Assistant

## Overview
This project is an **agentic AI system** that helps a contemporary artist discover and ethically engage with high-intent art buyers across Reddit, Instagram, and Pinterest.

The system uses a **multi-agent architecture** with Human-in-the-Loop oversight, ensuring that all outbound messages remain authentic, on-brand, and compliant with platform policies.

## Problem Statement
The client produces museum-quality art and has a professional online presence, but almost **no direct online sales**. Manual monitoring of thousands of social conversations is impossible at scale.

## Solution
- Social listening agents monitor art-related conversations.
- Filtering agents score and prioritize opportunities (0–100).
- Response agents generate three value-first response variants.
- A React dashboard lets the artist **approve, edit, or reject** each response.
- An RLHF loop learns from edits and approvals over time.

## Architecture (High-Level)
- **Frontend:** React + Socket.IO (artist dashboard)
- **Backend:** Python 3.11+, Flask 3.0 REST API
- **AI:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (reasoning), LangGraph multi-agent orchestration
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL (relational), Pinecone (vector search), Redis cache
- **Hosting:** Render (backend), Vercel (frontend)

## Folders
- `src/` – Application code (agents, API, utilities)
- `data/` – Sample or synthetic data for development
- `models/` – Configuration + artifacts for prompts and RLHF
- `results/` – Metrics, logs, evaluation exports
- `docs/` – Design docs, diagrams, and additional notes

## How to Run (Conceptual)
1. Start PostgreSQL & Redis services.
2. Launch the Flask backend (`src/api`).
3. Run the agent scheduler for collection + scoring.
4. Start the React dashboard.
5. Log in as the artist and begin reviewing opportunities.
